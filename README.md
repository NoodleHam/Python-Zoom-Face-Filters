# Python-Zoom-Face-Filters
A creative coding project on creating fun face filters with Python and OpenCV.\
Credits to [Daniel Otulagun](https://github.com/Danotsonof/) for the Python code for visualizing
OpenCV facial landmark detections.\
Credits to [Adrian Rosebrock](https://github.com/jrosebr1) for the Python code for visualizing
OpenCV facial landmark detections (with contours) (in `codesss/helpers.py`).

This code is part of the Tech@NYU event I hosted. More details about this code and how I came up with the filter can be found
at Tech@NYU's Events page [here](https://events.techatnyu.org/past-events/diy-zoom-filters-0324).
